## Project Idea
A website that sells art prints and processes payments through Stripe.



## User-Stories
As a user, I want to view all prints so I can choose which one I want.

As a user, I want to purchase prints so that I can show my favorite pieces of art.

As a user, I want to add prints to my cart so I can keep track of my potential purchases.

As a user, I want to use my credit card to purchase prints so it is easy and care free.

As a user, I want to be able to see my past orders so I can keep track of how much money I spent on a particular date.



## 3rd Party APIs
